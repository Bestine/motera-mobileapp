# Python for Data Analysis

**Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and am empowered**

## Description 
Python is a powerful, modern programming language that has the capabilities required for experienced programmers, while being easy enough for beginners to learn.

The course covers everything you need to get started with Python. The course also provides regular quizzes and hands-on exercises to enable you not only to understand the concepts but to practice them thoroughly. "Talk is cheap, show me your code", we want you to make mistakes, correct them and learn from experience.

## Course Outline
### Module 1: Python
This section covers the basics of Python, from python introduction to installing the required
tools.

- Why learn Python?
- What Python can do?
- How to install Python tool kits?

### Module 2: Fundamentals
In this section, we will lay foundations on programming basics, such as data types, operators,control flows, scope etc. These concepts can apply to other programming languages as well. You may have heard of **if** statement, **for** loops, **while** loop before. In this section, we will use real
examples to demonstrate the usage

### Module 3: Python Data Structures
Understanding data structures are vital to every programming. We will go through the three key data structures in Python and discuss how to use them efficiently.

- List/Tuple/Dictionary
- Methods in List/Tuple/Dictionary
- List comprehension

### Module 4: Pandas 
Pandas is go-to library for data analysis in Python. In this section, we will go into the details of pandas library functions, and how to read, extract, process, manipulate data in Pandas. The techniques in this section are often used in data science and machine learning processes.

- Slicing
- Indexing
- Grouping
- Filtering
- Updating

### Module 5: Numpy
Numpy is a python package for scientific computing. It provides a fast and flexible data processing data structure in Python. In this part, we will show how to use numpy to do data processing, such as slicing, indexing, grouping, filtering, updating, creating etc.

### Module 6: Functional Programming '
Python functional programming features can make data processing more efficient. In this section, we will cover a few functional programming, such as Lambda function,filter, map, reduce.

- Lambda
- Filter
- Map
- Reduce

### Module 8: File Input/output
In real life, data reside in files. In this part, we will introduce the python concepts necessary to use data from files in the programs, such as

- locate files
- open/read files
- write files
- close files

### Module 9: Course Project

In this section, you will get exposure to a real business case and process data using **Pandas** and **Numpy** to solve few business questions.
